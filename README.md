At the moment there seems to only be two type of mobile apps...

Native and HTML...

Most business tend to try native... and them move to HTML to save cost on dev and testing (which in the long run doesn't work). 
I decided that there must be middle ground, and as i have not heard of it, i decided to create it my self as POC. 

This POC is more of a way of satisfying my curiosity.
